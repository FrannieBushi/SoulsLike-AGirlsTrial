    "This is where an epic, glorious scene narrating the context of your adventure should appear… but unfortunately, the budget didn’t stretch that far.",
    "In this game, you’ll be playing as Vin.",
    "No, not *that* Vin from *Mistborn*. This one doesn’t have Allomantic powers or deep-seated trauma from her brother.",
    "And no, you won’t be joining Kelsier and the Skaa in their rebellion against the Lord Ruler either.",
    "Our Vin is a perfectly normal 21st-century girl: she likes anime, video games, and true crime documentaries about serial killers.",
    "Her boyfriend? Also a typical 21st-century guy.",
    "He loves cars, pretends to live by a stoic philosophy, and spends his afternoons passionately arguing on Twitter that *Elden Ring* shouldn’t have a difficulty selector.",
    "Speaking of *Elden Ring*, Vin is kind of stressed out.",
    "Her boyfriend wants them to play *Dark Souls III* together, and that’s just not her kind of game.",
    "And so, amid all that anxiety, Vin wakes up in an isekai.",
    "A world that, if it weren’t so obviously low-budget, could almost pass as something crafted by Hidetaka Miyazaki himself.",
    "Will you be able to help her escape this isekai?",
    "Or maybe… just maybe… Vin isn’t in another world at all and just went a little too hard on the weed."
