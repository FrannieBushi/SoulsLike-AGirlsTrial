    { "speaker": "Mistress Sidequest", "text": "Ah, another lost soul. Let me guess: no map, no clues, and spamming dash like that counts as stylish evasion, right?" },
    { "speaker": "Vin", "text": "I dash with surgical precision, thank you. And I'm way better equipped than you." },
    { "speaker": "Mistress Sidequest", "text": "Oh, shiny armor and proper weapons. How offensive to the narrative of suffering. I see you really took 'it's dangerous to go alone' to heart." },
    { "speaker": "Vin", "text": "I thought the ‘barely surviving’ look was optional." },
    { "speaker": "Mistress Sidequest", "text": "Nope, it's part of the ambiance. But hey, there's always one who shows up prepared." },
    { "speaker": "Vin", "text": "Let me guess—now you hand me a magic spoon and a tragic backstory no one asked for?" },
    { "speaker": "Mistress Sidequest", "text": "Close. Tragedies unlock in the DLC. For now, take this flask and a vague sense of impending failure." },
    { "speaker": "Vin", "text": "Ah, the true hero’s journey." },
    { "speaker": "Mistress Sidequest", "text": "And if you were looking for your prince, he’s in another castle—probably dating some emotionally unstable dragon." },
    { "speaker": "Vin", "text": "(Okay... I kind of like her.)" },
    { "speaker": "Mistress Sidequest", "text": "Also, here's this potion. It heals absolutely nothing unless you genuinely care about something in life." },
    { "speaker": "Vin", "text": "Then I’m doomed. I barely care enough to water my plants." },
    { "speaker": "Mistress Sidequest", "text": "You’ll fit right in." },
    { "speaker": "Vin", "text": "(Yup. Definitely my favorite NPC so far.)" }
